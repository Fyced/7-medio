# 7-medio
This was my very first programming project. I started it to start learning programming when I was 14 years old, and even though it is not well-structured, at least it works.

It is based on a game of cards, similar to blackjack, the aim is to be close to 7,5 without going over, the 10,11,12 count as 0,5. It was meant to be played with a spanish deck of cards.
